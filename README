Meldev is a plugin for Eclipse which provides some helpful features when editing 
MEL code.

FEATURES

- Syntax highlighting based on static list of mel commands
- auto-edit: autoindent on open brace CR
- naive completion based on open buffers
- 'send to maya' context menu item: over (TCP) commandPort

TODO

Flag Completion

proc/variable/command completion
 - need table of all procs, visible variables, commands to get proposals from
 Scanner options
  - allow optional ctags file to provide tags - kills flexibility of use
  - use ghetto regex scanner  -- java.util.Scanner ?
  - use real flex/bison-type scanner -- overkill
  - use command port connection to maya instance to get variable and proc list

integrated quick-help  

browse functions from all buffers
 - could do this in a separate view
 - could integrate into project explorer like java/pydev does -- but how?
 - depends on symbol table from above
 
each scanner should be preference change listener

code folding

templates

custom search tab - search procs, variables
 - use token list generated by scanner

KNOWN BUGS
 
syntax-highlighting: partial highlighting is happening
