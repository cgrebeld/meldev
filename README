TODO

Flag Completion

proc/variable/command completion
 - need list of all procs, visible variables, commands to get proposals from
 Scanner options
  - allow optional ctags file to provide tags - kills flexibility of use
  - use ghetto regex scanner  -- java.util.Scanner ?
  - use real flex/bison-type scanner -- overkill

browse functions from all buffers
 - could do this in a separate view
 - could integrate into project explorer like java/pydev does -- but how?
 
each scanner should be preference change listener

code folding

templates

custom search tab - search procs, variables
 - use token list generated by scanner
 
 partial highlighting is happening
